The button toggles a window that allows to pick the sort order.
The default order is alphabetical but fruits can be sorted by their nutritional content.
The default sort order is from ascending to descending or from greatest to least.

2. Add... button allows you to add a new fruit to the database.
The form contains form validation to ensure that the required fields are filled out.

3. The "X" next to the fruit buttons allows you to delete a fruit from the database.

4. Each fruit is a click-able element to display its details.

5. The search box allows you to search for fruits that have matching letters.
